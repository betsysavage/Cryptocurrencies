# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose:
This sample project analysis has been prepared for an investment bank "client" that is considering offering cryptocurrency options to investment portfolios. Because the cryptocurrency market is vast, the use of unsupervised machine learning is helpful in this scenario to cluster cryptocurrency options and observe similarities in the groupings. This analysis uses KMeans and Principal Component Analysis to create clusters and hvPlot to vizualize them.

## Resources and Code Sources:
* Crypto Data CSV file, from CryptoCompare
* Jupyter Notebook
* hvPlot, scikit learn, and pandas libraries
* Information on dataframe indexes accessed from Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18176933/create-an-empty-data-frame-with-index-from-another-data-frame
